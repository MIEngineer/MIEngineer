- Here is MIEngineer's PRIVATE workspace.
- I wanna make here just as trajectory of my practice, exercise, and trial & error place.
- I am undergraduate and not major in computer science - Uploaded here is not right answer, especially about efficiency.
- SO ANY COMMNET OR ADVISE WILL BE THANKFUL.
- My only wish is just this workspace is helpful to visitors, as other gits to me.
